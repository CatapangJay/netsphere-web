    api_port: 8728,
    device_type: 'mikrotik',
    credentials: await encryptData(apiCredentials)
  })
  .select()
```

**Real-time Features:**  
```typescript
// Subscribe to network alerts
const channel = supabase
  .channel('network-events')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'alerts' },
    (payload) => showToast(payload.new)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

**MikroTik API Proxy:**  
```typescript
// Next.js Route Handler
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { deviceId, command } = await req.json()
  
  const { data: device } = await supabase
    .from('network_devices')
    .select('*')
    .eq('id', deviceId)
    .single()

  const response = await mikrotikAPI(device, command)
  return NextResponse.json(response)
}
```
